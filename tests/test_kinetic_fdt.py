Kinetic Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) Validation Tests.

This module validates the Hermite moment implementation against analytical
predictions from linear Vlasov theory (Thesis §2.6.1, Chapter 3).

The FDT predicts the steady-state Hermite moment spectrum |g_m|² when a
single k-mode is driven with Gaussian white noise forcing. This is a critical
benchmark - if these tests fail, the kinetic implementation is incorrect.

Physics context:
    When forcing drives a single k-mode to steady state (ε_inj ≈ ε_diss),
    the time-averaged Hermite moment spectrum |g_m|² vs m should match
    analytical predictions from linear response theory.

    Two regimes:
    1. Phase mixing (large k∥): Energy cascades to high m via Landau damping
    2. Phase unmixing (small k∥): Nonlinear advection returns energy to low m

    The analytical expressions (Thesis Eqs 3.37, 3.58, Figs 3.1, 3.3, B.1)
    are exact, not fits - they come from solving the linearized kinetic equations.

Test strategy:
    - Drive single k-mode with forcing
    - Evolve to steady state (monitor energy saturation)
    - Time-average |g_m|² spectrum over steady-state period
    - Compare with analytical prediction (must agree within 10%)
